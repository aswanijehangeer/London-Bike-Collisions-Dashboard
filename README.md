# Bike Collision Dashboard - RShiny Web Application

The Bike Collision Dashboard is a Shiny web application designed to visualize and analyze bike collision data in London. The app features two main tabs: "Home" and "Data."

In the "Home" tab, users can select a specific borough and severity to view corresponding collision statistics. It provides a set of value boxes for quick summary insights and interactive plots (a bar chart and a heat map) that dynamically update based on user input.

The Data tab offers a table view of the dataset for detailed exploration.
